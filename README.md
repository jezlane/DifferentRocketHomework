# DifferentRocketHomework

### Summary
This repository is aimed at exploring a number of new Frontend web technologies that interested me and wanted to explore further. I used a template framework (a homework assignment) to test them against a number of regular development scenarios.

### No Install, no build
Using these technologies does not require an installation process or a build process. All libraries are CDN referenced, and all paths are relative. 

Developing this site didn't require a build process to be installed. 

### Technologies used
- **JSONata** -- like XLST for JSON, a JSON query and transformation language
- **lit-html** -- HTML templating library for JavaScript (superseded by Lit)
- **haunted** -- React-like Hooks API but for web components
- **IPFS** -- Secure Peer-to-peer hosting framework

### Demo location

- on Github Pages 
-- https://jezlane.github.io/DifferentRocketHomework/index.html
- via CloudFlare
-- https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmT8U55yGYENEAdj397hNFqWRT5pXpiw853jFxuH7a1s2m
- via IPFS direct

- with a Brave Browser you can use the native connection:

### Conclusion
Think all these technologies are great, however they vary in their readiness for production:
- **JSONata** -- most robust of the technologies and probably ready for production setting
- **lit-html** -- Replaced by Lit (lit.dev)
- **haunted** -- Looking forward to it being implemented with Lit, before a production setting
- **IPFS** -- Interesting replacement to CDNs and other static data in general. Interested in other browser plans to include native connection
